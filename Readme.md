You wake up in a strange place with only an artificial intelligence to talk to. You must play games in order to prove you are fit to go out on your own. Once you pass the tests, the AI will let you go. Will you be able to make it out or will there be a reason as to why you would not want to go?

To play, type your answers next to the ">" prompt at the bottom of the screen.
